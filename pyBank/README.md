This Pybank assignment  is to 
identify the length of the dataset
calculate the total of profits/losses ,so we know whether we got profit or loss.
need to find out changes in profits/losses by calculating the difference in between the two consecutive rows
then, need to find average of them.
last we need to find Greatest increase and decrease in profits.
Finally we can know we got profit or loss by looking at the values.
we are writing the ouput values to a file as well as on the terminal window.
